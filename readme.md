# Flow - an expense tracking tools
__Flow__ is a set of command line tools designed to simplify expences tracking, analysis and forecast. Working in conjuction with your favorite editors for JSON and CSV files it helps to maintain your budget.

# How to use it?
## Prerequisites
__Flow__  works with a PostgreSQL database, so you'll need to spin one up and save connection string into flow configuration. Before the first use, you need to apply database migrations from `Flow.Infrastructure.Storage.Migrations` project using [EF Core .NET Core CLI tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/get-started/overview/install#get-the-net-core-cli-tools). They are already referenced in `src\.config\dotnet-tools.json` so you'll just need to run `dotnet tool update` as mentioned in the guide.
Once tools are installed, please use `dotnet database update -- %CONNECTION_STRING_HERE%` command in _Migrations_ project folder. Don't forget to replace `%CONNECTION_STRING_HERE%` with actual connection string.

__Flow__ works best together with file editors, but they are optional. Apps can always record output to file or print it to STDOUT so you can examine the results of the command without any editor.

## Configuration
CLI tools uses [.NET Configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/configuration) with [json](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/configuration-providers#json-configuration-provider) and [Environment Variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/configuration-providers#environment-variable-configuration-provider) providers available. 
You can write settings to _appsettings.json_ file in the working directory, specify a separate file location in `FLOW_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable or set environment variables to override anyting what's already in settings file.

There are quite a few settings to provide, and most of them optional:
* `flow:ConnectionString` - required. A connection string to PostgreSQL database that handles data;
* `flow:CultureCode` - optional. Culture code (2-letter language, 2-letter region) that should be used to read or write data. App will use current culture by default;
* `flow:Editor:JSON` - a path to external editor for JSON files. Empty by default;
* `flow:Editor:CSV` - a path to external editor for CSV files. Empty by default;

## Expences tracking
`accountant.exe` is the tool that helps to manage information about accounts, transactions, transfers and exchange rates.
### Transactions management
Flow allows to capturee following information about transactions: Timestamp, Amount, Currency, Category, Title, Account Name, Bank Name.
Once stored, every transaction receives a unique Key value and user receives an opportunity to provide a Note, and overrides for Title and Category.
Overrides will replace original values on flow lists.

All information can be exported or imported in one of 2 supported formats: CSV or JSON.

`accountant list` is the command accountant executes by default. It exports recorded transactions that meets input criteria. The criteria allows to filter by 
* `k` - Key
* `ts` - Timestamp
* `a` - Amount
* `c` - Currency
* `cat` - Category
* `t` - Title
* `acc` - Account name
* `bnk` - Bank
* `ocomm` - Comment 
* `ocat` - Category override
* `ottl` - Title override

Following operation are supported:
* equality: `=`
* likeness: `~`
* comparison: `<`, `>` , `>=`, `<=`
* in-range: `[]`, `[)`, `(]` `()`
* within: `(1, 2, 14)`

For example, `accountant list ts[2021-01-01:2021-10-01)` will return transactions with start date greater or equal to 2021-01-01 and strictly less than 2021-10-01. Another example, `k>200 a<0` will return all transaction with Key > 200 and negative Amount.

Transactions can be inserted using `accountant add` command, edited using `accountant update` and deleted by `accountant delete` command. Please refer to help screens for each of the commands for additional details.

### Transfers
Flow automatically detects various occurences of money transfers between accounts. That allows to exclude them from list of really valuable transactions and simplify analysis.

To check correctness of transfer detection algorythms you can use `accountant transfer list` command. Like `accountant list`, it accepts the search criteria for the set of transactions in which app will try to find transfers.
For each transfer tool returns Source (a Key of source transaction), Sink (a Key of sink transaction), Fee (difference between source and sink), Currency in which Fee was calculated and a Comment that explains why tool believe it's a transfer.

If necessary user can enforse a particular transfer by providing a pair of Source and Sink to `accountant transfer enforce` command. Previously enforsed transfers can be abandoned using `accountant transfer abandon` command.
