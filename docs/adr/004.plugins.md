# Plugin management

Status: Draft

## Challenge
Automatic transfers detection logic may vary for different _flow_ users. 
For example, some banks may create a transfers with diffrent source and sink names, which prevents built-in transfers detection from proper transfers detection.

This custom logic should not be placed in core asseblies. Instead, it should be attached as a plug-in.

## Solution overview
Assembly `Flow.Infrastructure.Plugins.Transactions.Contract` (placed at infrastructure level) contains a definiton of `IPlugin` interface. This interface indicates that particular class is a plugin for _flow_ that provides custom transactions management logic. 

Ancestors of `IPlugin` allows to specify plug-in kind:
* `ITransferDetectionPlugin` indicates that a plugin performs custom transfers detection
* Other plugin kinds may be defined for other extension points in this assembly in future

This assembly depends on `Flow.Domain.Transactions` from domain level, which allows to operate the same domain objects as core logic.

Assembly `FLow.Infrastructure.Plugins.Transactions` contains plug-ins loader and a bridge classes that incorporates plugins into main workflow.

The loader scans a particular folder (defined in _flow_ configuration as `PluginsPath`) and loads all the assemblies into separate loading contexts, and creates a bridge classes.
These bridge classess will then be registered as a part of separate Autofac module.
