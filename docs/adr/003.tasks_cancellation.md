# Task cancellation
## Context
Most of the operations Flow makes happens asynchronously. The guidelines below define common approach for creation of asynchronous methods

## Naming convention
Do not add `..Async` to method names. All the methods should use asynchronous operations whenever possible so it's redundant.

## Asynchronous overloads
Always use asynchronous overloads of methods exposed by classes from 3rd party libs and frameworks

## Cancellation Tokens
Always use overloads that accept _CancellationToken_. In case of multiple asynchronous operations method should check if cancellation was requested between operations.
If cancellation was requested, method should try to return meaningful fallback value, or, if it's not possible, throw an exception.
