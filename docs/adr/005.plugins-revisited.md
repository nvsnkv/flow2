# Revisited plugin management and new IO

## Challenge
Previously established plugin design had few disadvantages:
* proxy types need to wrap a plugin
* unable to initiate more than one instance of a plugin of same type

Additionally, it turned out that poor design of IO library restricted ability to define IO plugin (for example, read transaction directly from printouts from banks).
As a result the need to redesign both IO library and plugins management arose. 

## Solution overview
### IO
`SupportedFormat` type was changed from enum to a custom type convertible from and to string.
It allowed to define custom formats support (`-f csv-from-a-custom-bank` or even `-f html`).

`IFormatSpecificReader<T>` and `IFormatSpecificWriter<T>` interfaces were created to define a reader/writer that support specific format. Example of the reader interface can be found below.
```
public interface IFormatSpecificReader<T>
{
    SupportedFormat Format { get; }

    Task<IEnumerable<T>> Read(StreamReader reader, CancellationToken ct);
}
```
Next, `Flow.Infrastructure.IO` library was divided into several assemblies:
* `Flow.Infrastructure.IO.Contract` - defines readers and writers interfaces
* `Flow.Infrastructure.IO.Calendar` - provides types for calendar handling
* `Flow.Infrastructure.IO.Criteria` - provides types for criteria parsing
* `Flow.Infrastructure.IO.CSV` - readers and writers that works with CSV 
* `Flow.Infrastructure.IO.JSON` - readers and writers that works with JSON
* `Flow.Infrastructure.IO` - main assembly that provides collections of readers (`IReaders<T>`) and writers (`IWriters<T>`)

Now, if you need to read transactions from a stream, you need to
1. receive `IReaders<RecordedTransactions> readers` from DI
2. obtain a reader for particular format: `reader = readers.GetFor(new SupportedFormat('particular format`))`
3. read the data `await reader.Read(streamReader, ct)`

This change allowed to introduce
1. custom formats
2. plugins that works with these formats

### Plugins
An interface `IPluginsBootstrapper` with a single method `IEnumerable<IPlugin> GetPlugins()` was created to support multiple plugin instances of same type.
Now plugin loader will scan for bootstrappers, initialize them, and call `GetPlugins` to obtain plugin instances.

Adapter types were removed - extra effort to support them. Instead of adapters and custom plugin interfaces for each case plugins now must implement at least `IPlugin` and one of interfaces from "contract" assemblies
* Flow.Application.Transactions.Contract
* Flow.Infrastructure.IO.Contract

As it was defined in [004](./004.plugins.md), the plugin still has no access to app DI container and gets registered as a singletone.
The list of supported "contract" interfaces is defined in `Flow.Infrastructure.Plugins.Loader`.

Now, the sample plugin looks like this:
```c#
// plugin.cs

public sealed class CustomTransferDetector:IPlugin, ITransferDetector
{
    /// ...implementation of ItransferDetector
}

// will be created using Activator.CreateInstance(...);
public sealed class Bootstrapper : IPluginsBootstrapper 
{
    IEnumerable<IPlugin> GetPlugins() 
    {
        yield return new CustomTransferDetector();    
    }
}
```

## Drawbacks
* No way to ensure in compile time that a reader or particular writer is defined - infrastructure relies on DI and generic types, so there may be surprises in a runtime
* Configuration became more challenging - now user needs to provide an editor for a custom format by himself
* A type `Flow.Application.Transactions.Contract.IncomingTransaction` was introduced due to following interface resolution issue: turned out that Autofac is unable to resolve `IFormatSpecificReader<(Transaction,Overrides?)>` if ValueTuple was defined in a different assembly.
