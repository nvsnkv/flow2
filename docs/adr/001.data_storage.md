# Data Storage
## Context
The domain model for flow is relatively simple. RecordedTransaction is the key item we need to store, and there are few supplemental details like account information, exchange rates or manually marked transfers that we need to store in the data storage.
Items from Analysis subdomain (Income/Expences list, calendars) are computed entities which do not require persistent storage.

## Guidelines
1. Modules that provide data storage functionality should be placed on __l2__ (see ADR 000);
2. Modules must implement and expose storage interfaces defined in __l1__ modules in `...Infrastructure` namespaces;
3. Each module should work with single type of underlying storage (DB, file ...). Single module may provide services for multiple sub-domains;
4. In case if domain model does not fit storage well, internal ancestor class (or a separate class with defined conversion) should be created within a module.

## ORM
For relational database an ORM should be used. _Entity Framework Core_ considered to be default ORM.

### EF Core migrations
Migrations should be placed in a separate module on __l2__
